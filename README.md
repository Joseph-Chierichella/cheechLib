# cheechLib
'cheechLib' is a useful, easy to use, and lightweight C++ library. CheechLib was made to make my C++ experience more productive and simple. Almost as if useing C++ as a high level programming lauguage.

# include
to use the library, you must have the repository in your project. All u have to do is include the 'include.cpp' file.
```cpp
#include "cheechLib/scripts/include.cpp"
// should be somewhere at the top of the file!
```
